# Play

https://www.playframework.com/

Encouraged to download and use the Activator to start the project.

Took about 10 minutes to download & install Activator and create a Play project, but this couldn't be readily imported into Eclipse.

Took another hour to run "$ activator test" as it had to download and install a large number of dependencies.

## First Impressions

I despise annotated models for ORM integration. This completely eliminates using consistent models across projects, frameworks, and purposes.

When starting play, take all your current Java preconceptions and lay them at the door. There is no place for them here.

Unable to compile basic Ebean example: https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-computer-database-java/blob/master/app/models/Computer.java
